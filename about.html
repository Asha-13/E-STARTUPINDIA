        Startup India is a flagship initiative of the Government of India,
        intended to build a strong eco-system for nurturing innovation and
        Startups in the country that will drive sustainable economic growth and
        generate large scale employment opportunities. The Government through
        this initiative aims to empower Startups to grow through innovation and
        design. In order to meet the objectives of the initiative, Government of
        India is announcing this Action Plan that addresses all aspects of the
        Startup ecosystem. With this Action Plan the Government hopes to
        accelerate spreading of the Startup movement:<br />
        • From digital/ technology sector to a wide array of sectors including
        agriculture, manufacturing, social sector, healthcare, education, etc.;
        and<br />
        • From existing tier 1 cities to tier 2 and tier 3 citites including
        semi-urban and rural areas.<br />
        The Action Plan is divided across the following areas:<br />
        • Simplification and Handholding<br />
        • Funding Support and Incentives<br />
        • Industry-Academia Partnership and Incubation
        <br /><br /><b>Details</b><br />
        Young Indians today have the conviction to venture out on their own and
        a conducive ecosystem lets them watch their ideas come to life. In
        today’s environment we have more Startups and entrepreneurs than ever
        before and the movement is at the cusp of a revolution. However, many
        Startups do not reac h their full potential due to limited guidance and
        access.<br />
        The Government of India has taken various measures to improve the ease
        of doing business and is also building an exciting and enabling
        environment for these Startups, with the launch of the “Startup India”
        movement.<br />
        The “Startup India Hub” will be a key stakeholder in this vibrant
        ecosystem and will:<br />
        • Work in a hub and spoke model and collaborate with Central & State
        governments, Indian and foreign VCs, angel networks, banks, incubators,
        legal partners, consultants, universities and R&D institutions<br />
        • Assist Startups through their lifecycle with specific focus on
        important aspects like obtaining financing, feasibility testing,
        business structuring advisory, enhancement of marketing skills,
        technology commercialization and management evaluation<br />
        • Organize mentorship programs in collaboration with government
        organizations, incubation centers, educational institutions and private
        organizations who aspire to foster innovation.<br />
        To all young Indians who have the courage to enter an environment of
        risk, the Startup India Hub will be their friend, mentor and guide to
        hold their hand and walk with them through this journey
